Whispers of the Morning

The sun peeks gently through the trees,
A golden hush upon the breeze.
Birdsong spills from every height,
Welcoming the waking light.

The dewdrops dance on blades of green,
A fleeting world, fresh and serene.
Shadows stretch and yawn with grace,
As warmth caresses Earth’s still face.

The flowers turn their heads to see
What wonders morning’s light might be.
A quiet hum, a world anew,
Bathed in skies of softest blue.

Footsteps stir the forest floor,
As day begins to open door.
Dreams dissolve in morning’s gleam,
Softly fading like a dream.

Each breath a note in dawn's sweet song,
A moment short, yet deep and strong.
In silence deep, the heart can hear—
That morning brings all life near.
